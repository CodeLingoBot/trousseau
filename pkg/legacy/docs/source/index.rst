Welcome to trousseau's documentation!
=====================================

Trousseau is a **gpg** encrypted key-value store designed to be a *simple*, *safe* and *trustworthy* place for your data. It stores data in a single multi-recipients encrypted file and can supports both local and remote storage sources (S3 and ssh so far) import/export.

Create a *trousseau* store, specify which *gpg* recipients are allowed to open and modify it, add some key-value pairs to it, export it to S3 for example, and re-import it on another device. As simple as that.

Whether you're a devops, a paranoid guy living in a bunker, or the random user who seeks a simple way to store it's critical data in secured manner. *Trousseau* can do something for you.
